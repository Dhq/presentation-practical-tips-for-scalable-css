Hi, my name is Daniel and I work as a systems developer in the Bergen office.
I am one of those (there are a actually a few of us) who likes to tinker with css. And it isn't so much that
I love css, or javascript for that matter, as languages or techniques, it is just that UI development on the web
really gets me going. And for us who do this... css and javascript, we are kind of stuck with those two. So we
need to force ourselves to love them. We need to embrace z-index, vertical centering, function is undefined,
NaN is not a number and all that crazy stuff. But this talk wont be about javascript, it will be about css.
And the thing with css, and what motivated this talk, is that my gatherings from my short career as a web developer
are that developers tend to marginalize css and never really dig deeper into it because "they know it". Like most people
get to a point where they understand the basics, and then don't care to really learn a lot more or think about their
css. For languages on the server or even javascript, we (sometimes) test it, structure it with care, think twice about
our implementations, we deepen our knowledge constantly etc. but with css we just go to our main.scss and stick in a
html body #get-this#damn-modalDialog#to-the-front#god-damnit {
    z-index: 9999999999 !important;
}
So if you don't see what's wrong with this css, keep on listening...!
So seeing as how little love and thought css gets in a typical web project, it is amazing how much of the time is
spent chasing down and swearing over css-issues.

So that was a long intro, but in this talk I will try to show ideas that I think help in this particular area.

### CSS quality over time
## What makes good CSS

######## Respecting the cascade, itcss, folder structure, specificty, short selectors
######## BEM, ITCSS, Linting
######## Button demo with currentColor, ems and rems, bem

######## Relative sizing is good line-height, padding, margin, media queries, widths. Not for border widths.


####### If time,
So that was the big picture stuff I wanted to show, now to fill out this 30 min session I thought I'd rabble on a few stuf that
I think might be worth your time to look into regarding css
